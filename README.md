# iTrust2

Team Project for NCSU CSC 326 - Software Engineering

iTrust2 is an app for Health Care Providers (HCPs) that provides the ability to schedule and document office visits. For our project, we were tasked with designing a new HCP role, the 
Ophthalmologist, who can document unique Ophthalmologist office visits and appointment requests. We also created a new satisfaction surveys functionality. 

I was placed on the front-end team, designing and implementing the interface of the web pages and creating cucumber/selenium tests for them.
